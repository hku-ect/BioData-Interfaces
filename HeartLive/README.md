About HeartLive
[TODO]

For Windows Users there is an application for the HeartLive, see http://heartlive.nl/downloads that can also send out OSC data (by right-clicking on the heart-icon in the windows-menu and initiate analysing mode with the HeartLive application running and in the foreground pressing ctrl+alt+h).

For other users, the HeartLive is recognised by the computer as an USB-audio interface.

# BasicMax-Patch

You can download a simple Max/MSP script that translates the audio signal (via peak and trough analyses) to a mean bpm.
