# BioData-Interfaces

Here you will find information about different BioData-Interfaces and how you can use them.
The different BioData interface that we are in the process of researching are:

* Bitalino
* Hearlive
* Muse
* BrainWave
* Myo
* Webcam for heartbeat detection
* Eyetracker
* Manus VR

## Using (web)Cam for heartbeat detection

Using https://thearn.github.io/webcam-pulse-detector/ as starting point we researchd how you could use this in a live interactive installation.

* The webcam-pulse-detector works with Python3
* As dependencies you need to install opencv2 and Matplotlib

Using [this](https://github.com/ikbenmacje/webcam-pulse-detector) fork you can also send out the pusle as OSC message.
